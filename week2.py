# Variable
# Any word before the =, works as a variable. Variables can also be numbers su
my_var ="hello"
print(my_var)

# F-String Syntax, Similar to printf() in java
y = 1 
x = 42
print(f"x is equal to {x}, and y is equal to {y}.")

# you can also format these at the end using .format(x,y), 
# which does the same as before but allows easy editing at the end
# note there is no f at the start of "", but has .format intead at the end.

# NOTES When using Python datatypes do not need to be specified as python
# will figure this out for itself. IMPORTANT

# Formatting a String
